# Assignment: Therapist Bot

## Why this assignment?

At Skooc, we build AI tools for mental wellness. This assignment is designed to test your ability to:

*   Prompt engineer LLMs for mental health-aligned use cases
*   Apply basic guardrails for sensitive conversations
*   Deploy APIs on AWS App Runner via Docker + ECR

We want to see if you can go from **idea ‚Üí API ‚Üí deployed service** quickly and cleanly.

---

## Problem Statement

Build a simple LLM-powered API that acts like a **CBT therapist** and responds to emotional queries in a structured, compassionate way.

---

## üéØ Functional Requirements

### 1. FastAPI App

*   Build an endpoint: `POST /respond`
    *   **Input:** `{ "message": "I feel anxious about exams" }`
    *   **Output:** `{ "response": "Let's explore that anxiety together. What's the worst that could happen?" }`
*   Use **any LLM API**.
*   Include a **system prompt**: _‚ÄúYou are a licensed CBT therapist helping users manage anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts. Speak warmly, don't overstep your boundaries.‚Äù_

### 2. Prompt Engineering & Guardrails

*   Engineer the prompt to **mimic a real therapist's tone**.
*   Add **basic guardrails**, e.g.,:
    *   No diagnosing
    *   Avoid medical or crisis advice
    *   Return: **"I'm not qualified to handle this. Please talk to a professional."** for red-flag keywords (e.g. suicide, self-harm)

---

## üöÄ Deployment (2 Parts)

### Part A: Docker + ECR + App Runner

*   Containerize the app with **Docker**
*   Push image to **Amazon ECR**
*   Deploy to **AWS App Runner** using the ECR image

### Part B: GitHub Repo + App Runner

*   Push source code to **GitHub**
*   Connect directly to **App Runner**
*   Set up **build-from-source** deployment
*   **Optional:** Set up **GitHub Actions** to automate deploys

---

## ‚ú® Bonus (Optional)

*   Add a **minimal HTML frontend** (input box + response display)
*   Use **GitHub Actions** to auto-push Docker image to ECR
*   **Log all requests/responses** with timestamps

---

## ‚úÖ Final Submission Checklist

*   [ ] Working `/respond` endpoint with prompt-based LLM output
*   [ ] Proper Docker setup
*   [ ] App Runner deployments:
    *   [ ] Public URL (from Docker + ECR)
    *   [ ] Public URL (from GitHub)
*   [ ] Clear documentation with setup + deployment steps
*   [ ] Prompt is warm, helpful, and has soft guardrails
